## Athletes

```{r}
skim(d)
```

### Number of Athletes

```{r}
athlete_game <- d %>% 
  select(season, year, id) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  count(season, year)

ggplot(athlete_game, aes(x = year, y = n, color = season)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Number of athletes at the Olympic games") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Athletes") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Year")
```

### Sex

```{r}
ggplot(count(d, year, sex), aes(x = as.factor(year), y = n, fill = sex)) +
  ggchicklet::geom_chicklet(position = position_fill(), radius = grid::unit(4, "pt")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Year") +
  labs(title = "Sex of Olympic athletes") +
  theme(
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank()
  )
```

### Age

**Youngest**

```{r}
youngest <- filter(d, age == min(age, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The youngest athlete ---*`r youngest$name`*--- was only `r youngest$age` years old when he participated in the `r youngest$games` Olympics (in `r youngest$sport`).

```{r echo = FALSE}
youngest
```

**Oldest**

```{r}
oldest <- filter(d, age == max(age, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The oldest athlete ---*`r oldest$name`*--- was `r oldest$age` years old when he participated in the `r oldest$games` Olympics (in `r oldest$sport`).

```{r echo = FALSE}
oldest
```

**Age by sport**

```{r fig.height=18}
ggplot(
  filter(d, !is.na(age)), 
  aes(
    x = fct_rev(as.factor(sport)),
    y = age,
    fill = sport
  )) +
  geom_violin(color = NA) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal_length(
    pal_spectrum,
    length(unique(d$sport))
  )) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.title.y = element_blank())
```

### Weight

**Lightest**

```{r}
lightest <- d %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  filter(weight == min(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(name, sex, height, weight, team, sport) %>% 
  distinct()
```

The lightest male was `r filter(lightest, sex =="M") %>% pull(name)` with `r filter(lightest, sex =="M") %>% pull(weight)` kg.  
The lightest female was `r filter(lightest, sex =="F") %>% pull(name)` with `r filter(lightest, sex =="F") %>% pull(weight)` kg.  

```{r}
lightest
```
Note: the lightest male may be a data error, considering his height, and unlikely BMI of `r filter(lightest, sex =="M") %>% mutate(bmi = weight / (height/100)^2 ) %>% pull(bmi)`.

**Heaviest**

```{r}
heaviest <- d %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  filter(weight == max(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(name, sex, height, weight, team, sport) %>% 
  distinct()
```

The heaviest male was `r filter(heaviest, sex =="M") %>% pull(name)` with `r filter(heaviest, sex =="M") %>% pull(weight)` kg.  
The heaviest female was `r filter(heaviest, sex =="F") %>% pull(name)` with `r filter(heaviest, sex =="F") %>% pull(weight)` kg.

```{r}
heaviest
```

**Weight by sport and sex**

```{r fig.height=18}
ggplot(
  filter(d, !is.na(weight)), 
  aes(
    x = weight,
    y = fct_rev(as.factor(sport)),
    fill = sport
  )) +
  geom_boxplot(
    width = 0.7, 
    size = 0.2, 
    outlier.size = 0.02, 
    outlier.alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal_length(
    pal_spectrum,
    length(unique(d$sport))
  )) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(30, 150)) +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none", 
    axis.title.y = element_blank())
```

### Height

**Shortest**

```{r}
shortest <- d %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  filter(height == min(height, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(name, sex, height, weight, team, sport) %>% 
  distinct()
```


The shortest male was `r filter(shortest, sex =="M") %>% pull(name)` with `r filter(shortest, sex =="M") %>% pull(height)` cm.  
The shortest female was `r filter(shortest, sex =="F") %>% pull(name)` with `r filter(shortest, sex =="F") %>% pull(height)` cm.  

```{r}
shortest
```

**Tallest**

```{r}
tallest <- d %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>%

```

The tallest male was `r filter(tallest, sex =="M") %>% pull(name)` with `r filter(tallest, sex =="M") %>% pull(height)` cm.  
The tallest female was `r filter(tallest, sex =="F") %>% pull(name)` with `r filter(tallest, sex =="F") %>% pull(height)` cm.  

```{r}
tallest
```


**Height by sport and sex**

```{r fig.height=18}
ggplot(
  filter(d, !is.na(height)), 
  aes(
    x = height,
    y = fct_rev(as.factor(sport)),
    fill = sport
  )) +
  geom_boxplot(
    width = 0.7, 
    size = 0.2, 
    outlier.size = 0.02, 
    outlier.alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal_length(
    pal_spectrum,
    length(unique(d$sport))
  )) +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none", 
    axis.title.y = element_blank())
```

### Participation

Number of games in which the athlete has participated.
```{r}
d %>% 
  select(id, name, games) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  count(id, name) %>% 
  select(-id) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Number of games in which the athlete won a medal
```{r}
d %>% 
  filter(!is.na(medal)) %>% 
  select(id, name, games) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  count(id, name) %>% 
  select(-id) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

## Medalists

```{r}
medalists <- d %>% filter(!is.na(medal))
skim(medalists)
```

Medals by athlete

```{r cols.print=6}
medals_athlete <- d %>%
  group_by(id, name) %>%
  count(medal) %>%
  mutate(medal = str_to_lower(medal)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = medal, values_from = n) %>%
  select(-`NA`) %>%
  mutate(across(c("gold", "silver", "bronze"), ~ replace_na(.x, 0))) %>%
  mutate(total = gold + silver + bronze) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(total))

sports_athlete <- d %>% 
  select(id, sport) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  mutate(nr = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = nr, values_from = sport) %>% 
  unite(sports, 2:ncol(.), sep = ", ", na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup()

left_join(medals_athlete, sports_athlete, by = "id") %>% 
  select(name, sports, total, gold, silver, bronze)
```

Male athletes with most olympic medals

```{r}
medalists %>% 
  filter(sex == "M") %>% 
  count(id, name) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10) %>% 
  rename(medals = n) %>% 
  rowid_to_column("rank") %>% 
  left_join(sports_athlete) %>% 
  select(-id)
```

Female athletes with most olympic medals

```{r}
medalists %>% 
  filter(sex == "F") %>% 
  count(id, name) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10) %>% 
  rename(medals = n) %>% 
  rowid_to_column("rank") %>% 
  left_join(sports_athlete) %>% 
  select(-id)
```

## Multipotentialites

With the term *"multipotentialite"* I refer to athletes with olympic medals in multiple sports.

Filter athletes with medals in more than 1 sport

```{r}
multipotentialite_id <- medalists %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  count(sport) %>% 
  count(id) %>% 
  filter(n > 1) %>% 
  pull(id)

# number of multipotentialites
n_unique(multipotentialite_id)

# select multipotentialites among medalists
multipotentialite <- filter(medalists, id %in% multipotentialite_id)
multipotentialite
```


## Country Stats

### Total Medals

> Important note: this is just an approximation, because data are at athlete-level and *not* country-level. Thus, team sports are overrepresented, as a single winning event is assigned to multiple athletes.

Total number of medals per country from `r min(d$year)` to `r max(d$year)`

```{r cols.print = 5}
medal_count <- d %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  count(medal) %>% 
  mutate(medal = str_to_lower(medal)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = medal, values_from = n) %>% 
  select(-`NA`) %>% 
  mutate(across(c("gold", "silver", "bronze"), ~replace_na(.x, 0))) %>% 
  mutate(total = gold + silver + bronze) %>% 
  select(region, gold, silver, bronze, total) %>% 
  ungroup()

medal_count
```

### Most Medals

Top 25 countries with most olympic medals\
*(not very informative ---not taking number of athletes and times participated into account)*

```{r rows.print = 25, cols.print = 6}
medal_count %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = total, n = 25) %>% 
  rowid_to_column("rank")
```

### Times Participated

Number of games in which countries have participated

```{r}
times_participated <- d %>% 
  select(region, games) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  rename(events = n)

times_participated
```

### Win Percentage

Number of medalists (any color) divided by number of participants per country per year

```{r rows.print = 25, cols.print = 10, digits = 1}
win_ratio <- left_join(
    count(d, region, year),
    count(medalists, region, year), 
    by = c("region", "year")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year)) %>% 
  rename(participants = n.x, medalists = n.y) %>% 
  mutate(medalists = replace_na(medalists, 0)) %>%
  mutate(ratio = formattable::percent(medalists / participants))

win_ratio %>% 
  select(-medalists, -participants) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = ratio)
```

### Highest Win Percentage

Country with highest medalists/participants ratio per year

```{r cols.print = 5, rows.print = 40}
win_ratio %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(ratio == max(ratio)) %>% 
  select(year, region, ratio, medalists, participants)
```

### No Medals

`r medal_count %>% filter(total == 0) %>% nrow()` participating countries are still awaiting their first medal.

```{r}
medal_count %>% filter(total == 0) %>% pull(region)
```

## Sports Stats

### Unique Sports

Winter Olympics
```{r}
sports_winter <- d %>% 
  filter(season == "Winter") %>% 
  pull(sport) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  sort()

sports_winter
```

Summer Olympics
```{r}
sports_summer <- d %>% 
  filter(season == "Summer") %>% 
  pull(sport) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  sort()

sports_summer
```

Sports that have been part of both the summer and winter Olympics
```{r}
base::intersect(sports_summer, sports_winter)
```


### Times on Schedule
  
Times a sport has been on the Olympic schedule, incl. first and last year
```{r}
sport_stats <- d %>% 
  group_by(sport) %>% 
  summarise(
    first = min(year),
    last = max(year),
    times = n_unique(year)
)

sport_stats
```
  
Sports that have been on the Olympic schedule only once
```{r rows.print = 10}
sport_stats %>% 
  filter(times == 1) %>% 
  select(-times, -first) %>% 
  rename(year = last) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year))
```

Number of unique sports
```{r}
sport_count <- d %>% 
  select(year, season, sport) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(year, season) %>% 
  count()

ggplot(sport_count, aes(x = year, y = n, color = season)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Unique sports at the Olympic games") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Sports") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Year") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Season")
```

Number of unique events
```{r}
event_count <- d %>% 
  select(year, season, event) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(year, season) %>% 
  count()

ggplot(event_count, aes(x = year, y = n, color = season)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Unique events at the Olympic games") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Events") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Year") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Season")
  
```

# Chord Diagram

I decided to create a chord diagram of the crossover between sports by *multipotentialites*.

## Data Preparation

### Pivot Data

Pivot wider (1 row per athlete)

```{r}
multipotentialite_pivot <- multipotentialite %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  select(id, name, sport) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(id, name) %>% 
  mutate(nr = paste0("sport", row_number())) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = nr, values_from = sport)

multipotentialite_pivot
```

### Expand Grid

Expand grid for non-directional/symmetrical chord (A to B == B to A). I decided to keep the chord non-directional, because in some cases (medals won during the same event) it wasn't clear which medal came first.

```{r}
bidirectional <- multipotentialite_pivot %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(grid = list(expand_grid(
      source = c(sport1, sport2, sport3),
      target = c(sport1, sport2, sport3)) %>%
    filter(source != target))) %>%
  select(-starts_with("sport")) %>%
  unnest(grid)

bidirectional
```

### Unique Sports

```{r}
sports <- medalists %>% 
  filter(id %in% multipotentialite_id) %>% 
  pull(sport) %>% 
  sort() %>% 
  unique()

sports
```

```{r}
nsports <- length(sports)
nsports
```

### Create Matrix

Create matrix with all options

```{r rows.print = 34}
m <- left_join(
  expand_grid(source = sports, target = sports), 
  count(bidirectional, source, target),
  by = c("source", "target")) %>%
  mutate(n = replace_na(n, 0)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = target, values_from = n) %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "source") %>% 
  as.matrix(
    nrow = length(sports), 
    ncol = length(sports))
```

### Set Colors

Color only sports with an frequency greater than 5

```{r fig.height=3}
# find sports with frequency > 5
colorsport <- bidirectional %>% 
  count(source) %>% 
  filter(n > 5) %>%
  pull(source)

# create color vector with base color
colors <- rep("#e3ded3", times = nsports) 

# add names to color vector
names(colors) <- sports 

# specify manual palette
manual_pal <-
  pal_length(
    c(
      "#da3238",
      "#d43f85",
      "#5d2e91",
      "#3656a4",
      "#107fb8",
      "#3a9e8d",
      "#77bb52"
    ),
    length(colorsport)
  )

# replace base color with color from palette for selected sports
colors[which(sports %in% colorsport)] <- manual_pal

# show colors
colorspace::swatchplot(colors)
```

## Draw Chord

In a first attempt I created the chord diagram with the `circlize` package in R.

```{r}
chordDiagram(
  m,
  symmetric = TRUE,
  grid.col = colors,
  order = colnames(m)
)
```

This result wasn't exactly what I had in mind (apologies for not fixing the ugly labels).

The chord diagram is non-directional due to the symmetric nature of the data. Therefore, coloring according to only one of the two sports feels inappropriate. An alternative is to create gradient chords based on the colors of both the source *and* target sport ---instead of only using the source color.

I read a great blog post by [Nadieh Bremer](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/2016/06/orientation-gradient-d3-chord-diagram/) on how to achieve this with SVG in D3. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out a way to do this with R yet. Therefore, I decided to continue the visualization in an [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) notebook using *SVG* and *D3.js*.

## Write Arrays

To use the data in Observable, I formatted the data as javascript arrays (in plain text) for copy-pasting into an [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) notebook.

```{r}
# main matrix
arr <- "["
for(i in 1:nsports){
  a <- paste0("[", paste(as.character(m[i, ]), collapse = ','), "]" )
  b <- ifelse(i == length(sports), "]", ",")
  arr <- paste0(arr, a, b)
}

# links
write_file(
  arr,
  here("code", "2021_31", "arrays", "links.txt"))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
cat(arr)
```

```{r}
# sports
write_file(
  paste0('["', paste(sports, collapse='","'), '"]'),
  here("code", "2021_31", "arrays", "nodes.txt"))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
cat(paste0('["', paste(sports, collapse='","'), '"]'))
```

```{r}
# colors
write_file(
  paste0('["', paste(colors, collapse='","'), '"]'),
  here("code", "2021_31", "arrays", "colors.txt"))

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
cat(paste0('["', paste(colors, collapse='","'), '"]'))

```
